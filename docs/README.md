# Documentation Index

This folder contains project documentation. Quick index:

- `01_hardware_setup.md` — BOM, wiring, and calibration notes
- `02_software_setup.md` — development environment and tools
- `03_docker_setup.md` — run local cloud stack (MQTT, InfluxDB, Grafana)
- `04_data_collection.md` — how to capture and format training data
- `05_fault_injection.md` — how to inject and label faults for datasets
- `06_model_training.md` — training, evaluation, and export to TFLite
- `07_deployment.md` — building, updating model, and monitoring

If you'd like, I can expand any doc with diagrams, sample scripts, or checklists.
